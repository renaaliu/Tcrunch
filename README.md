# Tcrunch
An Android app for the creation and delivering of classroom entry/exit tickets. 
Traditionally, teachers give a question to students and students will turn in their feedback on a notecard. 
Now, with Tcrunch, teachers will be able to setup a ticket on the app, and students 
will be able to respond directly without the hassle of notecards.


This is a project under the Center for Educational Resources at Johns Hopkins University.
